No effort put into optimization (using spheres, non-batched draw calls, no parallelism): ~33,000 @ 30FPS
- about twice as many if using cubes

After moving to compute shader, using GL_POINTS: >=8.3 Million @ 60FPS
- Downside: The CPU sets up the initial state (position, velocities, colors), so loading takes ~10-15 seconds (this was much less with only 1 million particles)
- Finally dropped to ~30 FPS with ~32 million particles
